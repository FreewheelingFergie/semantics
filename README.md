# L3T12 - Semantics
Requirement for the HyperionDev SE Bootcamp - L3T12

## Introduction
This task required the code extracts of L3T12 to be run in a file called 'semantic.py'
The file also contains some discussion points such as the differences between the two language models 'en_core_web_sm' and 'en_core_web_md'.

## How to run 'semantic.py'

You can run the python file by following the below steps:
1. Clone this repository onto your machine
1. If you have not already done so, you will need to download Docker Desktop by visiting https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
1. If you don't already have a Docker Hub account, visit this website and create one: https://hub.docker.com
1. Navigate to the directory which contains the Dockerfile and build a Docker image by running this command in Terminal (Macbooks): "docker build --platform linux/amd64/v8 -t [name of your docker image] ./"
1. Run the program by entering the following into your terminal: "docker run [image name]" NOTE: Afterwards the container will automatically shut down.
